## Homework 2

This homework is about modelling a business process using L2 pallete of own choice. Model had to have at least: 
* 8+ activities
* 4+ gateways (2 different types)
* 3+ intermediate events (2+ different types)
* 1+ data object
* 2+ text annotations
* 2+ pools, 1 as „blackbox/collapsed pool“, 2+ roles (swimlanes)
* 1+ exception and appropriate handling

It was possible to upgrade the model created in Homework 1 or create a model for a new process. Again it was possible to choose business process defined in [team project](https://github.com/binczech/PV207-BPM/). Chosen business process is from said team project and is described in [PDF file](/HW2/Pavlik_bpmn.pdf) which contains solution for this homework.
